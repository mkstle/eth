# 1. Set ethOS to single rig mode: http://ethosdistro.com/kb/#single-rig
# 2. In /home/ethos/local.conf , change "0x0bdC4F12fB57d3acA9C3cF72B7AA2789A20d27f2" to your wallet.
# 3. Reboot, and you are all set.
#
# Read the ethOS knowledge base, a useful guide to getting set up: http://ethosdistro.com/kb/
# Read the ethOS changelog for version information and latest changes: http://ethosdistro.com/changelog/

# DOCUMENTATION

#
# If using "pool" parameter, write WORKER (a placeholder variable) in place of rig name (i.e. NOT rig1, myrig, home, warehouse2, etc).
#
# pool:			use this if you have a network proxy or to define a getwork pool (example: http://pool.com:port/WORKER )
# stratumproxy:		enabled or disabled, if enabled, you will bypass "pool" and connect to stratum proxy located on this rig
# proxy wallet: 	the ethereum address to which this rig's proxy will mine (only used if stratumproxy is enabled)
# proxypool1:		this rig's stratum proxy's first pool (only used if stratumproxy is enabled)
# proxypool2:		this rig's stratum proxy's failover pool (only used if stratumproxy is enabled)
# flags:		set desired ethminer flags here
# maxgputemp:		the temperature in C that your GPUs will trigger ethminer to turn off
# globalcore:		set the global core clock of all GPUs
# globalmem: 		set the global mem clock of all GPUs
# globalfan: 		set the fan speed percent (0-100)
# globalpowertune:	set the power tune setting of all GPUs (notes from dev: 20 is default/max on everything except 290/390; r9 290 should use 50)
#
# Your [worker] names are assigned automatically by the OS, do not change them. They are 6-digit alphanumeric codes. 
#
# cor [worker]:	set the core clock of individual GPUs on a single rig
# mem [worker]:	set the core clock of individual GPUs on a single rig
# fan [worker]: set the fan speed of individual GPUs on a single rig
# pwr [worker]: set the powertune of individual GPUs on a single rig
# vlt [worker]: set the voltage (EXPERIMENTAL, MAY NOT WORK!) of individual GPUs on a single rig
# flg [worker]: set the ethminer flags of a single rig (applies to all GPUs on the rig)
# mxt [worker]: set the maxgputemp of a single rig (applies to all GPUs on the rig)
# reb [worker]:	increment this value (example: 4 becomes 5) and the single rig will automatically reboot within 10 minutes
# loc [worker]: set an 4-digit alphanumeric code for rack/location information for rig (NOTE: each rig MUST have a different code, or some rigs may not report to panel)
# sel [worker]: set the GPUs that should mine, default is no sel flag set, all GPUs may mine)
#
# AUTOMATIC REBOOT NOTES
#
# You are able to reboot remotely. Start with "1" (no quotes) to reboot a rig:
#
# reb a23def 1
#
# Then, if you want to reboot again, increment it to 2, then 3, then 4, etc etc (never skip any numbers).
